# RSC Kotlin

This project is a compiler for the programming language RageScript (which I made up, documentation following soonTM) written in Kotlin compiling to Python.
It uses the general structure for compilers found on Wikipedia. Some modules are missing because they are not necessary for RageScript or too complicated for the scope of the implementation.


This project uses a modified version of [this template](https://github.com/fwcd/kotlin-quick-start/)
